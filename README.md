# Machine-Learning
A Repository for Machine Learning Algorithms for easy Understanding
# A 100 day Machine Learing code pledge

### Day 1
  started from learing regression algorithm where we used the wiki/googl data of stocks to display data.
  ##### Libraries used: pandas ,quandl
  
### Day 2
  on day two we used the same data with labels and features and did some calculations on the data we were getting.
  ##### Libraries used:+ maths
  
### Day 3
  first time used linear Regression to test and train using linear_model from Linear Regression.
  ##### Libraries used : + numpy , sklearn
  
### Day 4
  firstly,we used regresion for forecasting and predicting the the future stock, also plotted the values
  ##### Libraries used : + datetime , matplotlib and style from mpl 
  
### Day 4 and 5 
  completed Siraj rivals linear Regression using Gradient Descent live stream work along to predict more practices mean better results

### Day 5
  learned pickling, in which we save our classifer as a pickle file and then loaded the pickle
  ##### Libraries used :  + pickle
  implemented best fit line slope eqaution y= mx+b , also made predict of y based on xs, plotted the points and line 
  #### Libraries used = numpy + matplotlib
