# A 100 day Machine Learing code pledge

### Day 1
  started from learing regression algorithm where we used the wiki/googl data of stocks to display data.
  ##### Libraries used: pandas ,quandl
  
### Day 2
  on day two we used the same data with labels and features and did some calculations on the data we were getting.
  ##### Libraries used:+ maths
  
### Day 3
  first time used linear Regression to test and train using linear_model from Linear Regression.
  ##### Libraries used : + numpy , sklearn
